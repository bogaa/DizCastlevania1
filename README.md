Dissasembly Output WIP

- Here I ported CV1 to a format so I can dissaemble it with Diztinguish. The idea is not to make a SNES game it is just convinient to use diz to dissasemble the game.
- When you assemble with Asar you get the file needed to view the dissasembly with Diz. https://github.com/IsoFrieze/DiztinGUIsh
- The output is ment for research but it can also be assembled to the NES file with Asar when setting the proper org and base directives and adding a header.
